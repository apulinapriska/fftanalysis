# fftanalysis
MATLAB-based code for how to perform FFT analysis on some wavelets.

Currently I develop the code on 1-D wavelet and 2-D wavelet, 
with the condition of each wavelets on 2-D wavelets is independent each other.
Please do not use this code if you want to perform FFT on gravity datasets.
